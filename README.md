Bachelor's thesis - Electronic data conversion on personal computers and its application

The project was focusing on electronic data conversion between two usefull data storing file formats. The final product was able to convert tabular data from a CSV file format to a RDF file format.

This repository was created only to show the final product, it doesnt include commits from the actual project.


## ABSTRACT
Nowadays, the term semantic web is not yet one of the publicly known terms. The reason for this is the lack of computer-processable data. A huge amount of data is stored in the tabular format of CSV files, meanwhile it is very difficult for a computer to understand this data. An example of the solution are RDF files, which add information and links to the plain, undescribed data which guide us closer and closer to the Semantic Web. The assignment of this paper is to analyze the structured data of CSV and RDF files, also to design and implement a program that can transform files from one format to another and vice versa.

## KEY WORDS
CSV, RDF, data conversion
